## Introduction

This project focuses on understanding the key factors driving customer behavior in the banking domain by analyzing various features of banking products. It performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and visualizes key insights through heatmaps, bar charts, and other data visualizations. Additionally, a Power BI Dashboard is created to provide an interactive view of insights such as home loan and deposit analysis.
